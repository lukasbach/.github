# Support

The easiest way to get support when using any of my projects is to open a new discussion. If discussions are enabled in the respective
repository, you can click "Discussions" at the top of the repository page to get there. If you received helpful information in the discussion
responses that helps you to solve your issue, please select that response as answer. Also, if you find a solution to your problem, you can comment
your own discussion with what you found out. This helps other people with similar problems to find a solution faster.

If you find an issue that you believe is caused by the library or product you are using, please open a new issue for that problem. Please fill
out the issue template, include as many details about the issue as you have and, if possible, provide reproduction steps such as a code snippet
or a code sandbox link to show how the issue is caused. Information about your setup is also helpfup, such as Operating System, Browser and the version
of the library or product that you are using.

If you believe that you found a security vulnerability, I would be happy for you to get in touch directly. Please message me via contact@lukasbach.com 
as soon as possible. You can find out more about reporting security vulnerabilities [here](https://github.com/lukasbach/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

If you have specific questions, want to get support or just want to drop a comment, feedback or a kind hello, you can message me via contact@lukasbach.com.
I'm usually open for answering questions or a happy chat.
