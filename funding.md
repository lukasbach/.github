# Looking to support me?

I'm currently not actively looking for financial support for any of my open source projects. If you
want to support my work, I am happy for stars on Github or if you spread the word of any of my
projects that helped you in any way.

You can also support my projects by contributing in the form of collaborating in issues or discussions,
helping others that have issues with using any projects, or contributing additions or fixes for reported
issues.
